# Financial Inclusion in Africa
My solution to 'Financial Inclusion in Africa' challenge on Zindi:

# Research Question
Predict who is most likely to have a bank account

# Objectives
Make predictions for each unique id in the test dataset about the likelihood of the person having
a bank account,i.e. Yes = 1, No = 0.

Train your model on 70% of the data and test your model on the final 30% of the data.

# Business Success Criteria

Use the models and solutions developed to provide an indication of the state of financial 
inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

Providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ 
financial outcomes.


# Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this challenge is the percentage of survey respondents for whom you 
predict the binary 'bank account' classification incorrectly, e.g 1 - accuracy_score(y_val, model_y_pred) 
for whatever model picked.

Therefore, the lower the incorrect percentage we get, the better the model performance.
